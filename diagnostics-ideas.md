Diagnostics:

  - **X is the target value**
  - **K is the number of org internal values**
  - Exploitation Diagnostic
    - Purpose:
      - This will allow us to see if selection schemes can reach the target objective, even though there are multiple ways to get there.
      - Orgs will try to exploit a specific internal value.
    - Literature:
      - Exploration and Exploitation in Evolutionary Algorithms: A Survey
    - ORG Structure:
      - Organisms are length-K vectors of doubles.
      - K internal values (vector of k values).
        - [v1, v2, ..., vk]
      - Mutations can increase or decrease a specific K value.
    - Problem:
      - The environment is represented as K targets, each target _i_ corresponding to
        position _i_ in organism genomes.
      - Goal: to maximize fitness, each position in a genome should be as close
        as possible to the associated target _i_.
      - fitness(org) = |X - vi|, where vi is the internal value at position i.
    - Analysis:
      - How close to X can orgs get?
      - Could add neutral space around targets?
      - Phenotypic diversity
      - Phylogenetic tree
      - Solution count
        - A solution is an org that has at least 1 internal value that has reached X
    - Extension:
      - K numbers, all K internal values need to be X
      - As there are more and more numbers do you lose precision?
      - Add neutral space around targets

  - Structured Exploitation Diagnostic - Structured K Values
    - Purpose:
      - Some problems are structured in such a way where they require approach
        building block when trying to reach a solution.
      - This provides more of a relationship between the orgs internal values.
    - Literature:
      - Exploration and Exploitation in Evolutionary Algorithms: A Survey
    - ORG Structure:
      - Organisms are length-K vectors of doubles.
      - K internal values (vector of k values)
        - [v1, v2, ..., vk]
      - Mutations can increase or decrease a specific k value
    - Problem:
      - The environment is represented as K targets, each target _i_ corresponding to
        position _i_ in organism genomes.
      - Evaluation:
        - Starting from the beginning of an organism's genome, the subsequent value
          is evaluated only if it is greater than or equal to the first value.
      - Evolution should optimize the first value, then the second, then third,
        _etc._
      - fitness(org) = |X - v1| + ... + |X - Vj|

        - where vi is all other traits and i != k

  - Ecology Diagnostic
    - Purpose:
      - **default** ecology diagnostic
    - Literature:
      - STILL LOOKING ._.
    - ORG Structure:
      - Organisms are length-K vectors of doubles.
      - Mutations can increase or decrease a specific K value
    - Problem:
      - Same as harsh ecology diagnostic above, but no trait can take on a score
        below zero.
        - i.e., organisms only receive fitness from their maximum trait value; all
          other traits are given a score of zero (instead of a negative value)

    - Literature:
      - STILL LOOKING ._.
    - ORG Structure:
      - Organisms are length-K vectors of doubles (each double representing a trait).

      - One of the K internal values is a specialist trait (vk)
      - Mutations can increase or decrease a specific k value
    - Problem:
      - Variant on the ecology diagnostic.
      - Score on non-specialist traits is value in trait minus the score in the
        specialist trait.
      - Score on specialist trait is just how close it is to the target for that
        trait position.
    - Analysis:

        - **What does a solution look like?**

      - An organism should be be trying to get all of its K internal values to some target
      - Good hint objective:

    - Problem:
      - Given K and X beforehand, can organisms' reach X for all K internal values
      - Fitness(org, X, vi) = tens place - ones place
      - Ex, Fitness(org, X, vi) -> vi = 78 -> 70 - 8 = 62 = Fitness(org, X, vi) = 62
      - If an organism's internal value goes over 100, will do the same process as above

      - [v1=1, v2=2, ..., vk=k]
      - f(v1) = f(1) = 1, f(v2) = f(2) = 4, ..., f(k) = f(k) = k^2

      - Age based selection schemes do well here

  - Pareto front diagnostic **MAYBE**
    - explicit trade-offs
    - overall target, every time there's a mutation => equal and opposite mutation on another trait
    - how many combinations can the selection scheme look at?
    - lots possible!
