Diagnostics:

  - **X is the target value**
  - **K is the number of org internal values**
  - Exploitation Diagnostic
    - Purpose:
      - This will allow us to see if selection schemes can reach the target objective, even though there are multiple ways to get there.
      - Orgs will try to exploit a specific internal value.

    - ORG Structure: 
      - K internal values (vector of k values).
        - [v1, v2, ..., vk]
      - Mutations can increase or decrease a specific K value.
      - No instructions required, since org is essentially a bit string.
    - Problem: 
      - Given K values and some integer objective X, how close can the organisms get to X?
      - fitness(org) = |X - vi|, where vi is the internal value at position i.
