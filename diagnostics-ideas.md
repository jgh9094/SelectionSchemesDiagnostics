- Diagnostics
  - Exploitation diagnostic - k-values
    - Some goal (e.g., 100)
      - how close to 100 can it get?
      - extension: k numbers, all k numbers need to be 100; as there are more and
        more numbers do you lose precision?
      - Could add neutral space around targets?
  - Structured exploitation - structured-k-values
    - more of a relationship between values (trade offs?)
    - k numbers, e.g., targeting 100
    - as you go from the beginning, the second value only gets evaluated if it's
      equal to or greater the second value
    - need to optimize the first value, then second value, etc
  - Ecology diagnostic - contraditory-k-values
    - organisms are k values (traits)
    - if any individual organism can only be selected for one of the values, how
      many distinct niches can be filled at any point in time?
    - fitness contribution of any trait is: k_i - max(other k values)
  - Ecology diagnostic - k-values
    - **default** ecology diagnostic
    - organisms are k values (trait)
    - only score the highest value (don't give negatives), zeros for other objectives
  - Specialist diagnostic
    - organism is k values
    - variant on ecology metric
    - score on traits 1-(k-1) is value in trait minus score in the specialist trait
  - Bad hints diagnostic
    - (Emily's box problem?)
    - organisms are k values
    - k objectives (if objective is below 99, score = 0)
    - we give them a good hint objective
    - we given them a bad hint objective
    - how much does a single good hint vs single bad hint change outcomes?
  - Bias diagnostic
    - organisms are k values
    - k objectives, bias importance of each objective
  - Deceptive landscape
    - exploitation + sawtooth effect (fitness = 10s place, -ones place)
  - Overfitting diagnostic - noise
    - organisms are k values, all hit 100
    - put noise on the test cases (5 test cases associated with each trait)
    - mean will be 100, but with gaussian noise
  - Overfitting diagnostic - smoothness
    - regression
  - Exploration diagnostic
    - If there are many good places to go from here, can I find the right path?
    - Only the highest trait counts & sequentially from there, going forward
      any traits that are lower than it
    - expectation - age based selection schemes do well here
  - Pareto front diagnostic
    - explicit trade-offs
    - overall target, everytime there's a mutation => equal and opposite mutation
      on another trait
    - how many combinations can the selection scheme look at?
    - lots possible!
